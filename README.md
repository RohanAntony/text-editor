# text-Editor

Lightweight text editor that can perform basic operations and also support templating to allow users to develop skins for their website.
Will be developed and used parallely on the blogger application.

This editor generates html output which can be stored on the server.

## ToDo
- Implement a simple image upload API server which takes the file, generates a URL and returns the URL for data access.
- Can be done by implementing nginx which serves only .png files.
- Upload the file to the static directory with the renamed file and return the renamed file link.

- `test.html` is a simple implementaion of the text editor available on mozilla contenteditable documentation.
